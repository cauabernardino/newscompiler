## ‚òëÔ∏è Remarks for current version:

1) Command line option for choosing language.
2) Theres is no more need for Chromedriver.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

First, clone this repo with:

`git clone https://github.com/cauabernardino/newscompiler`

Then install the requirements:
- For Windows: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For Debian based Linux distros: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## üíª Usage

Use

* For Windows: `python newscompiler.py [language] 'SEARCH_TERM'`
* For Debian based Linux distros: `python3 newscompiler.py [language] 'SEARCH_TERM'` 

on your terminal, where `SEARCH_TERM` is the subject you want to know about. 

The language options are:

`[-e | --english] [-p | --portuguese] [-s | --spanish] [-f | --french]`

If there is no option, english will be the default value.


Example, if you want to use a subject with more than one word in french, it can be done by:

`python newscompiler.py -f 'star wars'` OR `python newscompiler.py --french 'star wars'`
